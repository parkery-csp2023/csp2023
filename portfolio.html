    <h1>   1.1.9 "Which House Are You"</h1>
    <img src="epichut.png" height="250">
    <h2>   In this project, a house is created based on user input. A quiz is used to ask questions to the user and the user responds by inputting a number 1-4 for each question. If a number greater than 4 is put in on any question, the quiz ends immediately. Based on the accumulated number at the end, a certain house is created. The houses available are: the barn, the basic house, the fun house, and the epic hut.

    <h1>   1.2.5 "Star Catcher 2077"</h1>
    <h2>   For this project, the goal is to drop the 'star' object within a certain amount of time into a designated basket, which in this case is represented by a picture of Travis Scott. The star is controlled by using 'a' to move left, 'd' to move right, and 's' to drop down. Once the star makes contact with the basket, the score increases by 1 and the basket randomly moves to the left or right, moving each time the score is increased.
