    <h2>   In this project, a house is created based on user input. A quiz is used to ask questions to the user and the user responds by inputting a number 1-4 for each question. If a number greater than 4 is put in on any question, the quiz ends immediately. Based on the accumulated number at the end, a certain house is created. The houses available are: the barn, the basic house, the fun house, and the epic hut.
